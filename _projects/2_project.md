### Overview
**Potensi Alam Riau** is a **web design initiative** that aims to promote local natural resources and empower community-based economic growth in Riau Province.  
This project was created as part of an academic and design exercise supporting the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, particularly Goal 8 (*Decent Work and Economic Growth*) and Goal 12 (*Responsible Consumption and Production*).

### My Role
As a **UI/UX Designer**, I focused on conceptualizing the visual identity and layout of the website.  
I designed the structure, color palette, and imagery to reflect the authenticity and richness of Riau’s natural products while ensuring a user-friendly browsing experience.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Design:** Figma, Canva  
- **Prototyping & Presentation:** Figma components, mockups, and interactive wireframes

### Design Highlights
- Developed a **clean, minimalist layout** emphasizing local identity and eco-conscious branding.  
- Integrated visual storytelling through imagery and typography.  
- Created a **prototype flow** demonstrating user navigation and product exploration.  
- Ensured accessibility and consistency across design components.

### Outcome
The design served as a **prototype and concept website** to showcase how digital platforms can promote sustainable local products.  
It helped strengthen my understanding of **user-centered design** and **visual communication for impact-driven projects**.
