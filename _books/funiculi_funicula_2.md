This is the **second book** in the *Funiculi Funicula* series, set in the same magical café in Tokyo.  
Each story offers a fresh perspective on love, loss, and the meaning of time — making it a touching and beautifully written sequel.

### 💭 Lessons Learned
From this sequel, I learned that **time travel is not about changing the past**, but about *understanding ourselves better*.  
Each character’s story shows how empathy and forgiveness can bring healing even when nothing else can be fixed.  
It left me thinking that **time itself is less important than the emotions we share in it**.
