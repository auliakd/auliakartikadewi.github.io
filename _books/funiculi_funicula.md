*Funiculi Funicula* is a novel by **Toshikazu Kawaguchi**, first published in **2015**.  
It tells the story of a mysterious café where customers can travel back in time — but only if they follow specific rules.  

I read this book between **late 2023 and early 2024**, and it left a lasting impression about time, regret, and second chances.

### 💭 Lessons Learned
This book reminds me that while we can’t actually change the past, we can **change our understanding** of it.  
Every moment of regret can transform into peace when we learn to accept what happened and express what was once left unsaid.  
It also taught me that **small human connections** — even brief ones — can last forever in memory.
