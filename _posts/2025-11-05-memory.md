When I first entered university, I remember feeling small.  
The classroom was full of new faces, and I didn’t know anyone in my class.  
For a moment, I wondered whether I would be able to make friends or feel like I belonged here.

But slowly, things opened up.  
I made friends who were warm, patient, and genuine.  
I learned how to speak up more, how to start conversations, and how to step forward even when I felt unsure.

Originally, I wanted to study Design, because I loved drawing.  
But my parents encouraged me to choose a major that felt more *“clear”* and *practical*, so I entered Information Systems.

At first, it felt like a compromise.  
But over time, I understood that I actually enjoy technology.  
Not the heavy coding part (I still laugh at myself there),  
but the idea of helping people work better through systems and information.

It turns out, this path fits me too.

My interest in technology and AI grew around semester five, especially when internship and thesis discussions began.

Around the same time, I was also improving my English.  
I started as a learner, then became a co-mentor, and eventually a mentor.  
It was funny, because I still felt my English was far from perfect.

But teaching taught me how to stay humble, keep learning, and stay connected.  
I met students and fellow mentors from many places.  
Some of them, I still keep in touch with today.

There were many small moments that made my university life feel alive.  
Laughing with friends, late group projects, and warm conversations with lecturers who felt more like companions than strict authority figures.

And yes — I once got totally lost in Singapore.  



I panicked for a while, but looking back, it’s one of the funniest memories I have.  
Traveling, learning, getting lost, finding my way — it all became part of who I am.


If I could summarize my journey in one word, it would be:

**Growing.**

Not fast.  
Not loud.  
But steady, warm, and real.
